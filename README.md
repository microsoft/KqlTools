# Real-Time KQL
![.NET Core Desktop](https://github.com/microsoft/KqlTools/workflows/.NET%20Core%20Desktop/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push)

In order to view event logs today, users generally have to rely on tools that will first upload their data to storage **and then** query it. With Real-Time KQL, this is no longer necessary. Event processing happens **as events arrive, in real-time**.

[Get started](Doc/GettingStarted.md) right away with using Real-Time KQL or learn [how it works](Doc/Readme.md).
